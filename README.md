BabelBrain is a frontend application for research purposes only in the study of applications of transcranial focused ultrasound. BabelBrain calculates the transmitted acoustic field in the brain, taking into account the distortion effects caused by the skull barrier. BabelBrain also calculates the thermal effects that a given ultrasound regime, which is regulated mainly by the total duration of ultrasound exposure, the duty cycle of ultrasound use and the peak acoustic intensity,
