**GUI application for the modeling of transcranial ultrasound for neuromodulation applications**
BabelBrain is a frontend application especially designed to work in tandem with neuronavigation  software to perform focused ultrasound research. BabelBrain uses extensively [BabelViscoFDTD](https://github.com/ProteusMRIgHIFU/BabelViscoFDTD) for calculations. BabelViscoFDTD is optimized to run in multiple GPU backends (Metal, OpenCL and CUDA). In its initial inception, BabelViscoFDTD is focused for MacOS systems based on Apple ARM64 processors. However, BabelViscoFDTD can run in any system (Mac, Linux, Windows) that has a decent GPU from NVidia or AMD.
