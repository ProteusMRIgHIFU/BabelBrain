# Introduction
BabelBrain is intended to provide an estimation of transcranial ultrasound intensity generated by a transducer. This tool combines image processing to prepare domains for ultrasound simulation and the tool [BabelViscoFDTD](https://github.com/ProteusMRIgHIFU/BabelViscoFDTD/) to calculate acoustic fields using a solution of the visco-elastic equation. Predictions of this tool have been validated experimentally ([Pichardo *et al.*, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28783716/)) and cross-validated with other numerical tools for ultrasound propagation ([Aubry *et al.*, 2022](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/10.0013426)).
