# Usage
BabelBrain works in tandem with other tools for preprocessing and planning.

## Input Imaging
T1W and T2W images of subject are required. Highly recommended to be 3D isotropic (1mm resolution) scans.


## [SimNIBS](https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/index.html)
 SimNIBS Simulation of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation was developed originally for research on transcranial magnetic stimulation. BabelBrain requires output data generated by either SimNIBS 3.X's `headreco` or SimNIBS 4.X's `charm` processing tools that segment and parcelize bone, skin and brain regions. We recommend using the newer `charm` version available in SimNIBS 4.X (consult SimNIBS' Github [releases](https://github.com/simnibs/simnibs/releases))
