#Add an entry MultiPointTrajectory to specify here the focal spot locations with X,Y,Z coordinates, where origin (0,0,0) is at the GEOMETRICAL FOCUS.
# +Z is the propagation direction.
#if attribute MultiPointTrajectory is declared, tou need to specify at least one entry. Units are in mm
#In this example we create a 3-spot steering list. 
# Please specify 0 as 0.0
