#Add an entry MultiPointTrajectory to specify here the focal spot locations with X,Y,Z coordinates, where origin (0,0,0) is at the GEOMETRICAL FOCUS.
# +Z is the propagation direction.
#if attribute MultiPointTrajectory is declared, you need to specify at least one entry. 
# Units are in mm
# Please specify 0 as 0.0, 1 and 1.0, etc.
# In this example we create a 3-point steering list that makes a 3 point star with a radius from the origin of 2 mm
